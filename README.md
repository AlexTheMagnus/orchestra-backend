## Pre-installation requirements
- python3.8
- python3.8-dev
- virtualenv
- build-essential
- mysql-server
- mysql-client
- libmysqlclient-dev
- libsqlclient-dev
- libssl-dev

The all can be easily installed running `sudo apt install python3.8 python3.8-dev virtualenv build-essential mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev libsqlclient-dev libssl-dev -y`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These requirements will allow Orchestra to work on Ubuntu 20.04. For other operative systems they might change.



## Installation

1. Clone this repo and open a terminal inside the project folder.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to launch the DB container. If it fails, check that mysql.service isn't already running (in Linux, run `systemctl stop mysql.service` to stop it).
3. Create a Python 3.8 virtual environment (`virtualenv -p python3.8 .venv`). This step is only needed the first time you run the project.
4. Activate the python env running `source .venv/bin/activate`.
5. Inside the python environment, `pipenv install` to install all the project dependencies and run `python3 init_dbs.py` to create all the DB tables.
6. Reboot the virtual environment, run `deactivate` and then `source .venv/bin/activate` again.



## Configuration

Clone the `.env.example` file and rename it as `.env`. Then set up the following parameters:

- **DB_ENGINE**: DB container location.
- **DB_ENGINE_TEST**: Testing DB container location.
- **CLIENT_ID**: Spotify app client ID (Can be obtained from [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)).
- **CLIENT_SECRET**: Spotify app client secret (Can be obtained from [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)).
- **SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI**: Orchestra frontend location.



## Usage

Once the project is installed and configured, make sure to have up and running the DB container and active the virtualenv. Then, run `flask run` inside the virtualenv.



## Test

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Docker DB container must be up.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Installation and configuration steps are needed to run the tests.

1. In the `.env` file, change the `DB_ENGINE` env variable to match `DB_ENGINE_TEST` to use the testing DB.
2. To execute the tests run `pipenv run test` from the orchestra-backend root folder.
3. To use the production database, change back the DB_ENGINE value.



## Uninstall

The whole project is installed inside a virtual env. So, it's just needed to remove the project folder and the virtual env folder to uninstalled it completely. If you have followed the [Installation](#installation) section, your virtual environment will be inside the project folder in a folder named `.venv`.
